            <h1>Info</h1>
            <p>The information that you will find on this website will hopefully catch you bigger bass or atleast a bass.
                This site will go over some of the types of baits that are very effective at catching them. Also we will go in depth
                on the different seasons of the year. We will talk about how the temperature affects the bass and which baits might be most effective
                for that season.

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The reason why I created this website was to teach other people who do not know much about bass fishing to fish for bass. I did not know much about 
                fishing for bass, because I was never taught how to. I spent countless hours looking through different websites trying to
                find information on how to fish and what baits I should you, and countless hours more watching YouTube videos. I wanted all the different information
                on a single website and not go to different websites for different baits, so that is why this website was created.
